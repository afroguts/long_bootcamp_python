# python bootcamp
## learning the fundamentals of Software Engineering (SWE) so i can write some simple and intermediate Python scripts. 
we will learn how to work with variables, data structures (e.g. "list", "dictionaries" or "dataframes") 
and algorithms (for loop, lambda function) 
and software engineering principles from the ground up to working with Git, APIs and Databases (PostgreSQL)
and it is for an absolute beginner.
